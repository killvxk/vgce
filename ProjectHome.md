# Concept #
This project was created to host information-only content from video games, and host tools used to extract video game content, as well as documents on various file formats.

This project is also a hub for any documents, tutorials, general information, source code, etc. that I feel like uploading (lazily) to share.

It also contains garbage and incomplete documents that some people might be able to use (a man's trash is another man's treasure).
