```
```
"Quiet down, will ya?
I'm talkin' here!

```
```
"H-hey! Don't you

```
```
"HEY!"
```
```
"NO RESETTIN'!"
```
```
"YOU HEAR ME?!"
```
```
"Huh? You sayin' you never
reset nothin'?"
```
```
"Oh, well, uh.... Guess we ain't
got a problem then."
```
```
"So, lemme introduce myself.
Name's Resetti. Mr. Resetti."
```
```
"On behalf of the family,
I'd like to show youse....
I mean show YOU, uh...."
```
```
"Uh, show you.... Aw, forget it!
How's a mole supposed to
remember this garbage? HUH?"
```
```
"Let's cut to the chase. Ever
hear of Animal Crossing? Yeah?
Well, that's where I'm from."
```
```
"I'm the guy who stops cheaters
from cheatin'. The no-resettin'
policy enforcer, ya follow?"
```
```
"Ya break the rules, ya gotta deal
with the mole in charge here."
```
```
"I'm like the....how you say....
conscience of Animal Crossing."
```
```
"And, uh, I ain't one to toot my
own horn or nothin', but I'm a
big deal. I'm the most popular--"
```
```
"What's that? You ain't got time
for this?"
```
```
"You wanna know what it is I'm
doin' here?"
```
```
"You ain't heard a word I said,
that it? You got potatoes in
your ears, punk? HUH?"
```
```
"This is Super Smash somethin'
or other, ain't it?"
```
```
"Yeah? Then quit complainin'.
I'm SUPPOSED to be here. I'm
the star of the show, twerp!"
```
```
"Huh? What's that? I'm in the way?
Ya can't see the screen?"
```
```
"KEEP CRYIN', PUNK!"
```
```
"I got a little news for ya!
It don't matter if you're resettin'
anything, OK?"
```
```
"I'm gonna be poppin' up now an'
again, so you'd better be ready
for your daily dose of mole!"
```
```
"It ain't like this is all earthworms
and mudbaths for me, pal. I'm
just followin' orders. We clear?"
```
```
"SCRAM!"
```
```
"GRAARR!"
```
```
"NO....RESETTIN'!"
```
```
"UNDERSTAND?!"
```
```
"Whoa.... Phew.... Gotta catch....
my breath...."
```
```
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear ya.
Stop whinin' already!"
```
```
"But no one reset anything!
Blah blah dee blah." That's
what ya wanna tell me, right?"
```
```
"You ain't gotta say a thing.
I can see it in your eyes.
They're, uh, real expressive."
```
```
"Comin' out here is just somethin'
I gotta do, get me? Stop gettin'
so worked up."
```
```
"It's like crust on bread, you
know what I mean?"
```
```
"Cut it off, leave it on, who
really cares, am I right?"
```
```
"It's no big deal one way or
the other, get me?"
```
```
"Look, I don't wanna be here.
I got places to be, ya know?"
```
```
"I got a load of wet clothes sittin'
in my washin' machine."
```
```
"I don't get 'em hung up quick, it's 
wrinkle city. Think I wanna look
like a naked mole rat? Nuh-uh!"
```
```
"And the stench? Don't get me
started."
```
```
"But when duty calls, I gotta
answer. It's in my contract."
```
```
"Lemme tell ya about Assist
Trophies, all right?"
```
```
"They're items that call up
who knows what."
```
```
"Most of the time, it's some
good egg who's gonna help
you lay down the law."
```
```
"That's a good thing. Like a nice,
shiny new pick."
```
```
"Waitin' to see who shows up will
get that ticker pumpin', believe
you me."
```
```
"But that ain't what happens
when I'm on the job, get me?"
```
```
"I ain't here to take sides. I'm like
one of them countries that don't
fight in wars. Neutral, right?"
```
```
"I could help, but I don't. See, I
gotta show all you punks 'bout
self-control."
```
```
"It's that whole ''tough love''
song and dance. I gotta tell ya,
it ain't easy on me, neither."
```
```
"Yo, punk! You ain't gonna get
nowhere bumpin' into me."
```
```
"Whack me with a hammer, swing
for the fences with one of them
bats, it don't matter."
```
```
"None of that junk works on me.
I'm like a super mole, ya follow?"
```
```
"And sometimes, I just go
KA-BLAM!"
```
```
"SO WATCH IT, PUNK!"
```
```
"All right, then.... It's about time
for me to get tunnelin'."
```
```
"Oh, yeah, one last thing...."
```
```
"Take a bath, will ya? It's gettin'
ripe in here! Now...."
```
```
"SCRAM!"
```
```
"GRAARR!"
```
```
"I TOLD YOU!
NO RESETTIN'!"
```
```
"WHAT DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND?!"
```
```
"Ooh.... World's gettin' dark....
....Gotta stop spinnin'....
Whew."
```
```
"All that yellin' got me dizzy.
Ain't enough air around here.
Throat hurts, too!"
```
```
"So whaddya want? Huh?
You called me, didn't ya?"
```
```
"Yeah, I know, it's my job, so
there's no point in gettin' my
whiskers twisted, but...."
```
```
"When the sirens go off in HQ,
I gotta start diggin'."
```
```
"It don't matter what I'm doin',
I gotta drop it an' go."
```
```
"I'm eatin' dinner? Plate's on
the floor, fork's in the ceilin'.
In the tub? Wet mole."
```
```
"Don't believe me? Feel my fur!
Go on, touch it! TOUCH IT!
Point is, I ain't got a choice."
```
```
"None of you punks can see it,
but all I'm wearin' downstairs is
a towel!"
```
```
"I got dirt clods in places they
don't belong, understand?"
```
```
"And another thing...."
```
```
"What's the big idea treatin' me
like an item, huh?"
```
```
"If I could move around on my
own? Join this here brawl?
Oooh, look out!"
```
```
"I would tear this place right UP!
Mole elbow over here! BAM!
Dirt nap there! SLAM!"
```
```
"%s?
%s?
I'd eat 'em for breakfast!"
```
```
"Grr! What a rip-off! Where's it
written that moles gotta stay
underground? HUH?"
```
```
"Aw.... Forget it. Bein' a burrowin'
mammal ain't ALL bad, ya know?"
```
```
"I got dirt and worms....an'....dirt....
Well, I get to tell YOU what's
what, right? Set you straight...."
```
```
"That's good enough for me....
You bet it is...."
```
```
"....Sniff...."
```
```
"I ain't cryin'. I got dirt in my
eye, you hear what I'm sayin'?!
RESETTI DON'T CRY!"
```
```
"Listen, punk, bein' able to hop
and jump all over the place ain't
all it's cracked up to be."
```
```
"You don't stretch right, you
could twist an ankle or twang
a hamstring or somethin'."
```
```
"All that punchin' and kickin'
has gotta be hard on a body."
```
```
"I got no problem with you showin'
off your moves. Some of 'em are
pretty fancy, but...."
```
```
"What I don't wanna see is any
scrappin' 'bout who won and
who lost, ya hear?"
```
```
"Whew! I'm gonna run my yap
this much, I gotta buy me some
of them throat lozenges."
```
```
"All right, then.... I'm gonna hit
the tunnels."
```
```
"Do me a favor, will ya?"
```
```
"Use the restroom before ya hit
the sack! Now...."
```
```
"SCRAM!"
```
```
"

...."
```
```
"
....
You'd be runnin' home to Mama!"
```
```
"GRAARR!"
```
```
"You just don't get it, do ya,
punk?!"
```
```
"IT AIN'T ROCKET
SCIENCE, BUB!"
```
```
"All ya gotta do is NOT reset!"
```
```
"This ain't the time for more
roughhousin', twerps!"
```
```
"Your attention. I WANT IT!
Hey! I'm talkin' to YOU!
LOOK....OVER....HERE!"
```
```
"It's all I ever hear, I swear:
''Resetti's an utter maniac.''
''Meanest mole ever.''"
```
```
"Well, I've been workin' on a little
somethin' to show ya."
```
```
"Got a few tips from this
pygmy shrew voted class
clown at tunnelin' school."
```
```
"This works out all right,
I might pack up my pick and
hit the comedy circuit!"
```
```
"I think you're gonna like
this, so sit back and relax."
```
```
"First up! Impersonations.
You know, where I talk like
somebody else, get me?"
```
```
"Say hello to %s!"
```
```
"%s!"
```
```
"Well? Huh? How was that?
Dead ringer, right?"
```
```
"What? Dead stinker?"
```
```
"...."
```
```
"Hold it.... You laughin' at me?
THERE! I saw your nose
twitchin'! Now you did it!"
```
```
"UGHWAAH!"
```
```
"You're marked for LIFE!
I ain't NEVER forgivin'
you for this!"
```
```
"Comedy hour's done, but you
got front-row seats to a
prime-time horror fest!"
```
```
"Claws? Check! Pick? Check!
Rage-filled mole? Double-check!
This is gonna get ugly!"
```
```
"GRAARR!"
```
```
"
OUCH!"
```
```
"My.... My....back.... Oh, boy....
Musta pinched....a nerve...."
```
```
"My chiropractor warned me
not to get too worked up...."
```
```
"All this diggin' got my entire
spine outta whack. I'm
supposed to be takin' it easy."
```
```
"That's good news for you,
'cause it means I'm outta here."
```
```
"Guess I ain't got what it takes
to keep up with you. I'm gettin'
old, ya know?"
```
```
"Oh, but one last thing...."
```
```
"Get some shut-eye, will ya?
Stayin' up late's for punks!
Now...."
```
```
"SCRAM!"
```
```
"My impersonation of

```
```
"%s !

"WA HA HA!"
