"Wow! I almost feel like going
for a swim!"
```
```
"You swim in the ocean, too?"
```
```
"Don't make fun of me,
birdbrain!"
```
```
"Ahh, to be young again..."
```
```
"Fox! Be careful! I have a bad
feeling about this."
```
```
"What? Everything's fine--
I'm here!"
```
```
"That's what worries me
the most..."
```
```
"Use the B Button and Control
Stick combos for special moves!"
```
```
"Press Up or the X or Y Button
to jump!"
```
```
"What? You're just now
explaining the controls?!"
```
```
"Watch your radar carefully,
Fox!"
```
```
"Keep your eyes open!"
```
```
"Come on, Fox! What are you
doing?!"
```
```
"Be quiet, you old fogy!"
```
```
"Behind you, Fox! Stay alert!"
```
```
"Just don't give up. Trust your
senses!"
```
```
"Come on, Fox!"
```
```
"All ships report in!"
```
```
"This is Slippy! I'm all right!
I'm all right!"
```
```
"Peppy here! I'm a little shaken,
but I'm OK."
```
```
"Sorry... I've always wanted to
say that."
```
```
"Look out, Slippy! Enemies
behind you!"
```
```
"Fox! I think someone's on my
tail!"
```
```
"Get out of there, Slippy!"
```
```
"Thanks, Fox! I thought I was
done for!"
```
```
"Hold the A Button to charge
up shots!"
```
```
"Cut your way through with
a boost!"
```
```
"Aren't you guys thinking of
something else?"
```
```
"Falco! Don't let them get you!"
```
```
"This has gotten interesting!
I'm on the edge of my seat!"
```
```
"Calm down! This is where the
real battle begins!"
```
```
"Wait right there, Andross!
All ships report!"
```
```
"Hey, Slippy! Don't get too
excited!"
```
```
"Keep it together! Things are
about to get ugly!"
