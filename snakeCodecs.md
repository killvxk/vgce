# Mario #
```
"Snake, you know who that is?

You're kidding, right? It's Mario.

Mario made his first appearance in 1981,
and since then, he's become a worldwide
phenomenon.

There's probably not a single person
who doesn't know Mario. He's that famous.

Good thing I survived long enough to meet
him on the field of battle, huh.

This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance,
Snake. Now get out there and show
him what you're made of. No regrets.

Got it."
```
# Fox #
```
"Colonel! That fox is fast!

You're fighting Fox, eh, Snake?

His full name is Fox McCloud. He's the
leader of the commando-for-hire unit
Star Fox.

They're mostly active in a galaxy known as
the Lylat System.

Fox and his comrades pilot all-terrain
fighter crafts called Arwings. His skills in
combat can turn the tide of any battle.

...You seem to have a thing with foxes,
don't you, Snake?

Don't remind me. First FOXHOUND and
now this guy... I'm sick of foxes.

You and foxes have a long history together.
You ought to be proud."
```
# Luigi #
```
"That guy with the mustache...

Ha. You mean the "King of Second
Bananas"?

Hey, that's Luigi! Show him a little
respect!

Look at that pale skin. He's been living in
his brother's shadow for too long.

That's a low blow, Colonel!

Face it, Snake! Once a kid brother,
always a kid brother!

Colonel, what's gotten into you?!

La li lu le lo! La li lu le lo! La li lu le lo!

Colonel, snap out of it! Colonel!!
Coooooooloneeeeeel!"
```
# Ness #
```
"That kid... Isn't that Ness?

Ness?

He may look like a mere boy, but don't let
that fool you.

He has PSI abilities that defy all scientific
explanation.

Just like Psycho Mantis...

Exactly. He can use teleportation,
levitation, pyrokinesis, and
psychokinesis.

Yeah, but the question is, can he read
minds?

Not to my knowledge, no.

Good. Then I won't have to worry about
him predicting my every move. 

Even if he had telepathic powers, I don't
think he'd use them to mess with you like
that. I hear he's a good kid."
```
# Bowser #
```
"Careful, Snake! That's the great and
terrible Bowser!

Bowser? Looks like a cheap movie
monster.

Hardly. Bowser leads an entire army of
monsters. But I'd worry more about his
claws and fire if I were you. 

Doesn't look that tough to me. Seems kind
of slow, actually.

Well, he is the king of Koopas. It's only
natural he'd be slow.

But that's only because he's the heaviest
fighter here--by far.

He's a powerhouse of destruction.
Careful he doesn't flatten you."
```
# Zelda #
```
"Snake, I see you're fighting Zelda.

Yeah, I guess. Doesn't feel right fighting
someone in a dress, though...

Don't underestimate her just because
she's a woman.

Zelda's attacks are backed by powerful
magic.

Her hand-to-hand combat may look weak,
but her magic makes it cut to the bone.

So this rose has thorns... Interesting...

...This is no time for pickup lines, Snake.

Don't worry. I know from experience that
it's the quiet ones you have to watch out
for."
```
# Wario #
```
"This guy kind of gives me the creeps.

That's Wario, Snake.

Wario first appeared as Mario's rival, but
he really made his name in the WarioWare
games.

Watch out for Wario's bite. It's not just
damage you take from it.

What do you mean, Colonel?

Wario loves garlic. He eats whole cloves of
it day and night.

So try not to get caught in his mouth. Once
that smell gets on you, it'll stick to you for
quite a while.

...That's a scary thought.

He also attacks by farting. He can fart to
fly around, too.

By farting?! Are you kidding me?!

Sadly, no. I am not kidding. If his belly
starts to bulge, watch out."
```
# Pokémon Trainer #
```
"Pokémon Trainer... That's the guy
giving orders behind a Pokémon, right? 

Right, and this Pokémon Trainer is
controlling Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard.

They represent water, grass, and fire, and
they're all powerful.

So he makes his Pokémon fight while he
sits back and watches. Sounds like a good
deal if you ask me.

It's not like that, Snake. Those Pokémon
wouldn't know what to do if the Pokémon
Trainer wasn't there giving orders. 

In every battle, there's a soldier doing the
fighting, and a commander telling him what
to do.

By working together as a team, they
accomplish much more than either could
on their own.

So let's do this together, partner. 

...Yeah... Whatever you say, Colonel."
```
# King Dedede #
```
"Look at the size of that hammer...

That's King Dedede you're fighting, Snake.

Dedede? You mean it's not a penguin,
Colonel?

He's the king of Dream Land. Well, so he
says, anyway.

Are you sure he's not a penguin?

One full swing from that hammer can level
an entire building. 

It may look like just a big wooden mallet,
but it's actually outfitted with special
mechanical systems like turbo jets and pre-
cision bearings to boost its effectiveness.

I don't think I could even lift that thing.
And he's swinging it around like it was
nothing...

But he also leaves himself wide open.
Just make sure you avoid the swing,
Snake."
```
# Ike #
```
"This swordsman's gonna be tough to beat.

Fighting Ike, eh, Snake?

Ike is the leader of the Greil Mercenaries.
He may look too refined to be a fighter...
but he has one heck of a sword arm.

Yeah, he's swinging that two-handed
sword around with only one hand. I don't
even want to get near him.

That's the holy blade of Ragnell. It's an
extremely powerful sword. 

But don't forget. Snake, you're armed to
the teeth yourself. 

To your opponents, you might just be their
worst nightmare.

The distance between you and your enemy
is a crucial element in battle. Using that
distance can give you an advantage
against some enemies.

Yeah, I've got the same feeling..."
```
# Jigglypuff #
```
"Aw, there's a big eyeball walking around
here... 

That's just Jigglypuff.

Jigglypuff? That some kind of
marshmallow?

Jigglypuff is a balloon-shaped Pokémon.

It may be light and puffy and full of air,
but its Sleep ability is devastating.

Sleep...? What's so devastating about it
going to sleep?

The instant it falls asleep, there's a huge
buildup of energy in its center of gravity.

If it hits you, it's lights out for sure. 

So it puts a lot of energy into sleeping?
Sounds pretty irresponsible if you ask me.

Takes all kinds, Snake. Especially here in
''Brawl.''"
```
# Snake #
```
"Colonel, it's me! I'm fighting myself!

Snake, what's going on out there?!

Could it be...? Has the "Les Enfants
Terribles" project really come this far?!

It's more than that. He's got my moves,
my gear... It's like looking in a mirror. 

Do you think they collected data on you
and created another Snake...?

He's got the same build, too. Creepy. 

But his Sneaking Suit is a different color.
And his tactics are slightly different. 

Interesting. So even if you're evenly
matched in power, your fighting styles will
make a big difference.

You've faced tougher odds in the past,
Snake. Don't let this impostor beat you!!"
```
# Wolf #
```
"Colonel, there's a guy in here who looks
like a wolf... 

You mean the fighter named Wolf. 

''Wolf.'' Real imaginative name...

He's the leader of a ragtag team called
''Star Wolf.'' They're the longtime rivals of
Star Fox.

Kind of strange for a wolf to have friends,
isn't it?

Well, I don't think he works well with
others. I suppose they're more like
hangers-on than actual comrades. 

But he's a remarkable pilot. And his ship,
the ''Wolfen,'' is no slouch, either. 

But this is hand-to-hand combat, Colonel.
He's out of his element. 

Careful, Snake. Those claws of his aren't
just for show. "
```
```
"Otacon, there's a gorilla wearing a tie here.
He's huge.

That's Donkey Kong. As you can tell, he's
got strength to spare.

He may be king of the jungle, but he lives
in a house just like you or me. And he
seems pretty smart--well, for an ape,
anyway.

The Donkey Kong who fought that epic
battle with Mario was this guy's grand-
father. 

That was a long time ago. What about this
Donkey Kong? Does he get along with
Mario?

Nope, they're still at it. Seems like
they're always competing in something--
kart racing, sports, you name it.

A chip off the old block..."
```
# Link #
```
"Otacon, who's the guy with the sword?

That's Link. He's the hero of Hyrule. 

That blade in his hand is called the Master
Sword, also known as the "Blade of Evil's
Bane." 

He also has a whole arsenal of items at his
disposal--bombs and arrows, a shield, a
boomerang, and a Clawshot. He's a force
to be reckoned with. 

Gear is only useful when it's used at the
right time and place. Just lugging a ton of
it around doesn't do you any good.

...I, uh... I wouldn't be talking if I were
you, Snake.

What's that supposed to mean?

You tell me, Mr. Utility Belt.

..."
```
# Samus #
```
"Hey, Otacon. I got a woman here in a
Power Suit...

Huh? How'd you know she was a woman?

Yeah, that'd be Samus Aran, the most
renowned bounty hunter in the galaxy. 

Her Arm Cannon packs quite a wallop. If
you get hit with a charged shot from that
thing, you can kiss your butt good-bye.

Sounds like my kind of woman...

Yeah, well, just don't get too close, Snake.
Samus is deadly. 

After Space Pirates killed her parents, she
was raised by the Chozo and trained in the
fighting arts.

She's been places and seen things that
people like you and me can't even begin to
imagine.

But underneath that cold, metal exterior
beats the heart of a woman..."
```
# Yoshi #
```
"Otacon! What's this lizard thing?

That's a Yoshi. It's a dinosaur from Yoshi's
Island.

Watch out for its long, chameleon-like
tongue. If it gets you, you'll be swallowed
whole.

It lays eggs and throws them, right?
...Then it must be female.

...Actually, it's a "he." At least, that's what
it says.

It talks!?

Yes! It talks! Well, kind of...

Now you've got me curious. ...How about I
capture one so we can see what they taste
like?

Uhh, Snake..."
```
# Kirby #
```
"Snake! Watch out!

For what? That pink marshmallow?

That's Kirby, also known as ''Kirby from
Dream Land.'' 

He's from another planet--in other words,
an extraterrestrial.

He's got a powerful stomach that lets him
swallow and digest anything.

And he also has a ''Copy Ability'' that
allows him to mimic opponents, steal their
moves, and use those moves against them.

On top of that, he has the power to fly
around the stage, so once he's got you in
his sights, there's no place to run.

...Huh? Yeah, got it. I'll keep an eye out."
```
# Captain Falcon #
```
"Hey! That's Captain Falcon, isn't it!

Good eye, Snake!
He's F-Zero pilot number 07!

You know, seeing Captain Falcon here
reminds me... We should do that thing
we've always wanted to try...

Ohhhh yeah! That thing! Good idea!
OK, ready? Go!

Falcon Puuuunch!!

Falcon Kiiiiiiick!!"
```
# Mr. Game & Watch #
```
"Otacon, there's a guy walking around in
here...and he's only got two dimensions!

That's Mr. Game & Watch. He comes from
a world where everything is flat.

Game & Watch was a series of portable
games released by Nintendo in 1980.

They were powered by large-scale
integrated circuits and only had mono-
chrome LCD displays, so characters kind
of looked like the numbers on a calculator.

The guy you're looking at now,
Mr. Game & Watch, was a character who
appeared in these games. 

This is making my head hurt.

Well, um... He's... I mean... Look, just
start fighting him, and I'm sure everything
will make sense.

..."
```
# Ganondorf #
```
"This guy is giving off a murderous vibe!
Even getting close to him makes my skin
crawl...

Snake! Ganondorf is dangerous!

His ambition is to rule the world, and he's
got the power to do it.

It's no wonder they call him "King of Evil."

Do modern weapons even work against
him? Do I even have a chance?

Take a look around you. There are plenty
of people fighting with swords or even
their bare hands. At least you've got
firepower! Count yourself lucky!

It's not like you to whine, Snake. 

I was just asking, sheesh. Well, it's back
to the mission for me. "
```
# Pit #
```
"Otacon, there's a kid with wings out here.
Is he a mutant? Or is he just into
costumes?

That's Pit, Snake. 

Pit is an angel from Angel Land. He's the
captain of Palutena's Army. 

Angels. Give me a break!

I dunno, maybe he's from a different
species. But those wings on his back and
those mysterious weapons he has are the
real deal.

He may look young, but he's a veteran
warrior. Watch yourself.

He used to be a weakling, but countless
trials over the years have toughened him
up.

And by trials, you mean, ''Game Overs''? 

Yeah, you should know all about that. "
```
# Diddy Kong #
```
"Otacon, there's a chimpanzee here wearing
a Nintendo hat.

That's Diddy Kong. He's Donkey Kong's
partner. 

Not only is he lightweight, he can use a
wide range of weapons as well. 

He can fly using those barrel jets on his
back, and he can shoot nuts with his
Peanut Popgun.

Peanuts? As in the ones in the little
shells? Are you serious?

Wait, here's the best part. You see them
lying on the ground after he shoots?

If you pick up some of those peanuts,
they'll restore your health a little. 

Hmm. Edible ammunition, huh... Times
sure have changed."
```
# R.O.B. #
```
"So, Snake, you're fighting Robot?

Yeah, it's a robot. Although, couldn't they
have come up with a better name?

Actually, in the U.S. they called him
"R.O.B." Robot, R.O.B.--take your pick.

Fine. R.O.B. it is, then.

In North America, R.O.B.'s body was grey,
like the NES.

But in Japan, he had a white body and red
arms, the color of the Japanese Famicom. 

You sure know your geeky tech stuff,
Otacon.

Well, you know..."
```
# Sonic #
```
"... 

Snake, what is it? 

Something about that hedgehog rubs me
the wrong way...

...? Oh, you mean Sonic The Hedgehog?

But everyone loves Sonic. He's a big star. 

Do you have any idea how excited people
are that he's here in Brawl?

Yeah, I know, but there's something about
him I just don't like. 

But...why? You must have some kind of
reason.

...Nope, just don't like him."
```
# Pikachu #
```
"Ooh! How cuute!

What? The yellow thing? 

That's Pikachu. It's a Pokémon. They're
popular all over the world, you know.

And it may look cute, but be careful. It
can store up large amounts of electricity
in those adorable little cheeks. 

It'll try to pepper you with electric
shocks. 

Couldn't be much worse than Ocelot's old
torture device...

Oh, and, Snake?

What?

I was wondering, could you maybe try and
catch Pikachu for me? Pleeeeease?

Give me a break! What do I look like, a
Pokémon Trainer?

Fine... Sorry I asked. "
```
# Peach #
```
"Mei Ling, tell me what you know about
Peach.

Princess Peach is the beloved ruler of the
Mushroom Kingdom.

She's been kidnapped numerous times by
Bowser.

Sounds pretty serious...

Yes, but every time it happens, Mario ends
up saving her.

Sure, he may not look like your ideal
''knight in shining armor.'' A little on the
short side, I'd say...

But still, don't you think it's romantic? I
mean, to have a guy who's always there
for you?

If he was smart, he'd tell her to stop
getting kidnapped.

...You don't get a lot of dates, do you,
Snake?"
```
# Sheik #
```
"What's going on here? What happened to
Zelda?!

Snake, Princess Zelda transformed into
Sheik.

I can understand the clothes, but to
change her skin and eye color? That must
take some powerful magic.

...Magic...?

Come on, Snake! Don't get all grumpy and
start talking about how unscientific it is.

Science is basically just another form of
magic that makes our lives easier. 

I never thought I'd hear that coming from
you, Mei Ling.

Don't you think talking to someone halfway
around the world is a kind of magic? Or
flying across entire continents?

No. I think this is completely different."
```
# Ice Climbers #
```
"So those two are the Ice Climbers, huh? 

Snake, have you ever heard of a
''blood bond''?

Sure.

It refers to a bond between two people
that's so strong they'd die for each other.

The Ice Climbers have conquered frozen
glaciers and dangerous mountaintops
together. I think they've formed a bond
that we can't even fathom. 

I dunno. Seems to me they'd get in each
other's way fighting to see who gets to the
top first.

Snake, in China they say, ''Though
brothers may quarrel at home, outside
they defend each other from slight.''

Is that really a Chinese proverb?

Even though they may get in each other's
way occasionally, they'll pull together in
times of need. 

They're an inseparable team, Snake. Don't
underestimate them!"
```
# Marth #
```
"Snake, have you heard the saying ''Politics
makes strange bedfellows''?

Don't tell me that's a Chinese proverb.

Err, no... It means that when the going
gets tough, you might need unexpected
partnerships in order to succeed.

Marth was a prince whose kingdom was
usurped. He didn't even have an army to
fight with him.

But as he battled his way forward, he
found new allies to fight at his side, and in
the end, he was able to reunite the
war-torn land of Altea.

So he built his army from the ranks of his
defeated enemies...

Marth did his share of fighting, too. Even
when he had an army, he was always
alongside his men in the thick of battle. 

Then he was betrayed by one of his most
trusted friends. I can't even imagine how
that feels... 

...I can."
```
# Meta Knight #
```
"Mei Ling, there's a mysterious masked
man flying around here with a sword... 

That's Meta Knight. He's a knight from
Dream Land. 

They say his sword swings can break the
sound barrier. Whatever you do, don't get
caught in one of his furious barrage
attacks.

He also commands the Halberd, a flying
battleship.

Mm, I've seen it. The bow looks like his
mask. 

What kind of weirdo puts his face on the
bow of a ship, anyway? 

Umm, maybe he's a little narcissistic. Kind
of like someone else I know.

Really... And who would that be?

Use your imagination..."
```
# Zero-Suit Samus #
```
"Mei Ling, Samus took her clothes off!

That's just her in the Zero Suit, Snake. 

Without that bulky Power Suit, she's gotten
a lot more agile...

You know, I bet if I took off all this
heavy gear, I could catch her...

Um, yeah, you wish.

Even without the Power Suit, all that
training she did with the Chozo has made
her a super athlete.

I don't think a normal human could ever
keep up. Just look at her.

...Her loss."
```
# Captain Olimar #
```
"Snake, have you ever heard of the ancient
Chinese story, ''The Vain Ocean of Wealth
and Splendor'' from the Zhen Zhong Ji?

I've been waiting for the movie.

Basically, it's meant to express the
impermanence of all things.

You know, like even when Captain Olimar
has lots of Pikmin with him, they could all
be gone the next moment. 

Those poor little guys--they carry, they
fight, they multiply...and they get eaten. 

Olimar might have lots of company one
minute and be all alone the next. It's so
sad.

But he can pluck out more Pikmin anytime
he wants, right?

Well, yeah, I suppose so. 

No one truly fights alone. Not even me. 

...You're absolutely right, Snake. Good
luck. I'm rooting for you. "
```
# Lucas #
```
"I see you're fighting Lucas, Snake.

Lucas?

That boy has PSI powers, which he can use
for different kinds of attacks.

But the poor little guy's had such a hard
life.

His mother was killed when he was young,
and he was separated from his brother.

After that, he faced all kinds of senseless
hardships, and he slowly grew stronger. 

Senseless hardships--yeah, I had a lot of
those, too. 

The question is how you translate those
hardships into a better future.

...Mmm. Well, I hope things turn out OK
for him."
```
# Lucario #
```
"You're fighting Lucario, aren't you, Snake? 

Mei Ling, what's that purple fire coming
out of his hands?

That's his "Aura."

Aura?

I guess you could call it his life force.
Lucario can use his own Aura and
turn it into power. 

Every time Lucario's damage increases,
his Aura gains strength, making his attacks
more powerful.

So don't think you've got him beat just
because his health is down.

The cornered rat will bite the cat... Sounds
like trouble.

Hey! When did you become so good with
proverbs?!

You must have rubbed off on me.

Well, come back in one piece, and I'll
teach you all the Chinese proverbs you can
handle."
```
# Toon Link #
```
"Mei Ling, who is this kid with the cat
eyes...? 

Oh, they call him Toon Link. Doesn't he
look familiar?

Yeah, he looks just like Link. 

But you know there've been several people
who've gone by that name, right? 

They all have certain things in common--
green clothes, a sword, a shield... But they
all came from different lands and lived in
different eras. 

And yet the spirit of the hero of the
Triforce is timeless. It's an essence that
transcends history. 

I think I can relate to that.

Huh? What do you mean?

There's been more than one "Snake," too,
you know..."
```
# Falco #
```
"This is Snake... 

Copy, Snake! This is Slippy!

Whaa--! Who is this? What are you, some
kind of frog?! 

Easy there, buddy! Just thought I'd hop
on the wireless and give you a holler.
Don't get mad!

Hacked right into my channel, huh... 

But I'm not here to mess nothin' up. Don't
worry.

...

Just so ya know, Falco uses a Blaster and
Reflector that I designed, just like Fox
does.

But Falco will kick his Reflector and send
it flyin' around. Just showin' off, if you
ask me.

No reason a weapon can't have more than
one use.

In fact, I'd say its versatility shows how
well you designed it.

Hey, maybe so! I feel all fuzzy now!
Thanks, Snake!

Maybe next time we meet, you can design
me a weapon..."
